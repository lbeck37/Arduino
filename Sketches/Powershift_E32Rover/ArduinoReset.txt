From stevenk37 at http://www.instructables.com/id/two-ways-to-reset-arduino-in-software/

Let me give some details on the built-in arduino WD (yes, really) that can be used both as WD or as a reset device.

You can set it from 15ms to 8s range. You need to reset it in software or otherwise it will trigger a reset (reverse to #2 method).

Here's how to use it;
*/

#include <avr/wdt.h> //should be in any adruino IDE

void
setup ()
{
	wdt_disable (); //always good to disable it, if it was left 'on' or you need init time
//do some stuff here
	wdt_enable (WDTO_8S); //enable it, and set it to 8s
}

void
loop ()
{
//do some stuff here
	wdt_delay (5000)
	//instead of delay, i made my own delay to reset the WDT
}

//this makes sure the WDT is reset immediately when entering the
//function, but we can still benefit from a real 'delay'.
//upon leaving the function, we reset it again.
//i realize timing will be loose, you can always do something with
//millies() if you need strict timing.
//you might also need to adjust the '1000' if you WDT is shorter

void
wdt_delay (unsigned long msec)
{
	wdt_reset ();

	while (msec > 1000)
		{
			wdt_reset ();
			delay (1000);
			msec -= 1000;
		}
	delay (msec);
	wdt_reset ();
}

//to reload the board, you only have to delay > WDT
//another option is to set the WDT very short, and do a short delay

void
wdt_reload ()
{
	delay (8001);
}
