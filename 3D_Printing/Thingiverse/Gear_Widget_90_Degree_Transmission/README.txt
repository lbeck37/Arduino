# Summary

Another neat gear widget I made. The cool thing about this one is that it converts rotational motion 90 degrees at a 1:1 gear ratio. Gears like these are really cool, but are not very practical because its 45-degree pressure angle between gear teeth is pretty high (similar gears and cams don't run well with pressure angles over 30 degrees), not to mention the sliding of the teeth cause friction. As a toy though it works surprisingly well! And it's fun to watch.

A couple notes, I printed it without the little washer additions, So if you turn one of the gears the wrong way the other will pop out. But turning the same gear the other way keeps it in! I quickly threw together a couple press fit washers that should keep it in (it's actually 1/32" larger than the shaft, but for some reason, my printer spits those out as pretty tight press fits). I haven't tried the washers yet so they might not even work, but it's worth a try.

Let me know what you think! :)
