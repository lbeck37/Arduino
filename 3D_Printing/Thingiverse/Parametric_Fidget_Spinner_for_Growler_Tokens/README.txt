# Summary

I wanted to use the growler fill tokens from a local brewery (Phillips in Victoria, BC) but couldn't find a parametric spinner that would let me use different sized weights instead of just identical bearings. I may have slightly missed the bandwagon on this one, but I think this is a cool way to incorporate any token or coin to a fidget spinner.

This design allows as many weights (lobes) as you want, with adjustable thicknesses and diameters of both the weights and center bearing. It's currently sized for a 608ZZ bearing and dual tokens on each end. I plan to add caps for the bearing, as the tokens are quite large. I've got big hands, but for people who are more towards the Trump end of the hand size scale it could be difficult to hold.

There are some OpenSCAD renderings of different configurations (number of lobes, with and without the decorative holes) in the images, but the only real limit is the size of your hands, the size of your print bed, and Euclidian geometry!

I used Robo's rounded cylinders for the outer edges, and standard cylinders for the cutouts.

# Print Settings

Printer: D-Bot
Rafts: No
Supports: No

Notes: 
If you set the corner radius too big, you'll have almost no contact area on the bed, which may result in failed prints as the lobes peel off. Try sizing it as no more than half of the weight rim value.
