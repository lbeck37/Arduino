# Summary

This is a more ergonomic extruder release button for the Anet A8.  It has features in the base of the design that utilizes two of the tie-wraps that come with the A8 machine kit in order to retain the push button on the extruder screw.  It's a real finger saver.  Top of the unit is concave in order to prevent slippage. 

# Print Settings

Printer: Anet A8
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .1mm
Infill: 40%

Notes: 
Print the design with the screw hole downward. I use 230 degrees C for PLA with a heated bed at 50 degrees C.

# Post-Printing

Add two 3mm wide tie wraps into and out of the two sets of holes at the base of the design and tighten them securely with needle nose pliers.
