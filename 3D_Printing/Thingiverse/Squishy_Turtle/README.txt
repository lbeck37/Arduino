# Summary

This 3d printed turtle uses the same flex concept from my [Mini Monster Truck](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1557428) to create legs that allow the toy to bounce and scurry around when tapped. The head can also retract into the shell.

Check out my process for designing this thing [here](http://www.jacobstanton.com/3d-printed-squishy-turtle-design-process/)

The model assembles with the printed H-Clips and needs no glue. The parts print without the need for supports.

I had some fun designing the various shell patterns that can be printed. I can upload a blank shell file if anyone is interested in designing their own shell. 

If you are interested in my design process and latest 3d printing experiments, check out my [website](www.jacobstanton.com) and my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stantonjake89).

# Updates

Here is a list of updates since posting:
-bridge added to connect parts of the bottom piece to prevent print failure
-all stls have been adjusted to the proper print orientation
