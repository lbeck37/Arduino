# Summary

This is a development from Planetary 02 uploaded previously.  All gears reduced in size for a more pocketable gearset.

Each planet gear now has a 3mm hex center, for driving the assembly once it's freed, but also to help free the assembly.  Slide a 3mm hex/allan key into each gear, and gently flex the gear toward and away from the sun gear to break it free after printing.  Once all 10 gears are free, the assembly should start rotating with the rotation of one of the planet gears.  Movement will be rough to start but will free up the more you spin it and any fine printing strands get worn in or worn off.

The center spider was added to allow the addition of a driving point... In this case a 4mm hex/allan key.  Do not try to break the gears free by just using a 4mm key in the planet gear and twisting the ring gear... You *will* break something before it frees up.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK2.5
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.010
Infill: 100%
Filament_brand: Filamentum Extrafill 
Filament_color: Melon Yellow
Filament_material: PLA

Notes: 
Infill is not critical, but as the parts may need flexing to break any minute bridging the more solid the infill is the stronger the parts will be.  Print time was about 11 hours with 100% infill at .010 resolution.

# How I Designed This

Designed in Solidworks 2018, using built-in ISO straight gear profiles.  Once the teeth and pitch diameters were worked out, I used the "Flex" tool to twist each gear to give it the angled gear teeth, then mirrored the body to create the herringbone.

LibreOffice Calc was used to work out the number of teeth, pitch diameter, and twist angles.
