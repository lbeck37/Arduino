# Summary

Simple Hexagonal Fidget Hand Spinner
Bill of materials:
-6 x M10 nuts
-1 x 608 skateboard ball bearing
-1 x HEX body
-2 x HEX cap

Update 15.02.2017:
Added hex body for M8 nuts. The hex_cap is the same for both versions.

Please note that I have made them with exact dimensions measured on nut and bearing. If you have problems inserting the bearing and nuts, you can always upscale or downscale the model a bit in your slicer in order to make it fit

Update 13.03.2017
Added hex body and cap for "strange" nut by request.
Dimensions for nut: 14mm wrench, 8.22 thick
Dimensions for bearing: D=18.99mm; d=6mm; 5.98 thick
Note:
Made for exact measured dimensions. Small adjustments or up/down scale the models in slicer might be necessary. Added a small brim in body to keep the bearing in the middle plane of the body. File name contains STRANGE word. Have fun!
